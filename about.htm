    <p>Dyal Singh College owes its origin to the extreme generosity and foresight of Sardar Dyal Singh Majithia, founder of ‘The Tribune’ and ‘Punjab 
        National Bank’, who willed his vast wealth in 1895 for the setting up of an Education Trust for a secular college. Consequently, Dyal Singh 
        College was established at Lahore in 1910, and after the Partition of India, Dyal Singh College was established in Karnal and in Delhi. It 
        started functioning in the capital as a constituent College of the University of Delhi in 1959 and was later taken over by the University of 
        Delhi as a University maintained institution in 1978.The college has been contributing to the solemn task of nation-building since its very 
        inception. Today, Dyal Singh is imparting education to over 6000 students, including foreign students through facilities of Arts, Commerce, 
        Social Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Computers and Science courses.The college has a state of art infrastructure to meet the pedagogic and 
        research needs of its students and faculty members. These include a well-stocked Library with over one lac books and links to various e-resources. 
        The science departments have well-equipped labs to carry out both teaching and research activities. The computer department has also upgraded 
        computer facilities. The college works for the overall development of the personality along with the academic activities. Our motto is to nurture 
        today’s youth to face tomorrow’s challenges. Making them more employable has been the focus of our college. Our college placement cell takes care 
        of these issues. Sports has been one of the pillars of personality development. Our college, along with its rigorous academic standards it maintains 
        a vibrant tradition of co-curricular activities. Our students complement their academic lives with active engagement in the fields of sports, 
        theatre, debate, music, photography and fine arts. The college auditorium, amphitheatre and seminar rooms are designed with the latest sound and 
        projection systems to facilitate many academic and co-curricular exchanges.I am fortunate to be at the position to nurture young talent and make 
        the journey of the students joining the college a memorable one. Together, let us share our ideas, dreams and vision to make the learning process 
        an even more exciting experience. I wish the students who are joining the college success and an enjoyable stay at Dyal Singh College.
